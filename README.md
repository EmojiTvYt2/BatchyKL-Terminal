# Batchy Kali Linux - Terminal
### A Kali Linux Terminal made in batch.
***Not all command included due to some limitations.***

Well hello there! Welcome to my project!
This, is Batchy KL Terminal; a Klai Linux terminal (not all commands included) made entirely in batch!

To get info about all available commands enter command 'man' in the BKLT (Batchy Kali Linux Terminal)
**WARNING:** If an unknown to the code command or lack of the command
         will be entered into the terminal, the script will crash and close
         the window.
I don't know how to fix it.
If you know how to fix it WITHOUT ChatGPT, you can help and suggest your fix idea to this email here:
---Yeah I forgot to make an email for this and I still have a couple of email accounts to delete---

I did my best to replicate the Kali Linux terminal, I hope you'll enjoy your expiriance.

## Planned Updates
V1.2 - Opening programs (e.g. opening notepad or firefox ect with the terminal)
V1.3 - Commands: date/time, cal, whoami, pwd, history
V1.4 - Fixed invalid command crash bug & git clone text font change bug

### Supported Windows Versions
- Windows 10
- Windows 11

You ARE allowed to modify it, but if you use it for your own stuff, please give me credit if you use my code.

PS: In the script there are some unused variables which will maybe be used in the future updates
